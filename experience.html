    <h5>SickKids</h5>
    I am currently employed by The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and am working in Anna Goldenberg's lab at the
    Vector Institute. The focus of my work was is to take the work my advisor
    (<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~stonekaboni/index.html">Sana Tonekaboni</a>) had
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00750">recently done</a> on representation learning for time series data and
    expand on it. With guidance from my advisor, I've explored different encoder architectures for the model,
    imputation techniques, and ways to deal with positive and unlabeled samples
    (PU Learning). I've had the great pleasure to explore some interesting ideas in Information Theory, Variational Inference,
    and generative models.
    We are also working on applying this work to an ICU dataset from SickKids.

    <h5>UofT AI</h5>
    UofT AI is a student led group focused on bringing students from a variety of majors and backgrounds into the field of
    AI. I joined in early 2020, and quickly became involved in various projects, the largest of which is ProjectX: This
    is a 3 month long machine learning research competition focused on solving important problems related to climate
    change (see more details on the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page). I've also helped to put out a
    monthly newsletter that informs readers on the latest
    developments and opportunities in AI. During the summer of 2020 I helped organize weekly paper readings
    where we'd take an important (and usually technical) paper from the field of ML and discuss it.
    I've also helped cultivate a partnership with AI Commons to use our
    <br>
    (All members of UofT AI, including myself, are unpaid)

    <h5>Tyler Technologies:</h5>
    Tyler Tech is a massive provider of software for the public sector. I interned at Tyler for 2 summers on the software
    support team for a product called Munis. I worked on various projects and tasks while working at Tyler. Part of
    my time was focused on assisting customers with technical issues, through which I gained experience in both great
    communication as well as using SQL (when we had to fix mistakes in their database). I also did some data
    and text analysis for them: We exported a few spreadsheets of support case data and I applied some basic key word
    extraction and manipulation to gather information on common issues customers experienced with different releases
    of Munis. This informed some recommendations I made to my superiors at the end of my internship.
    <br><br>
    <h5>Anania and Associates:</h5>
    I interned at this local private equity firm between my junior and senior year in high school. The company owns
    majority or full stakes in many Maine businesses, including Elmet Technologies (a metal producer). I worked with
    another intern (a college student) to help update the Elmet website to include ecommerce functionality using
    WordPress. I also designed and developed a simple iOS app that allowed Elmet employees to quickly calculate weights
    given the metal type, product type, and dimensions.
    <br><br><br><br>
    At all of my internship experiences, I've been praised for my initiative and willingness to learn. Employee
    recommendations are available upon request (You can email me <a href="mailto:addison.weatherhead@mail.utoronto.ca">here</a>).
