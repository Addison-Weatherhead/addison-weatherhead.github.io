    <h5>Building a neural network using just Numpy: Summer 2020</h5>
    As I discovered my passion for Machine Learning (and more specifically, Neural Networks) I learned that the way
    most people approach the subject is to use Tensorflow or Keras to create a powerful network to predict something.
    While I'm interested in the performance and simplicity of using tools like this, I wanted to get a deeper
    understanding of how a neural network <em>really</em> works. I found <a href="https://nnfs.io">this</a> awesome
    book that teaches you how to build a neural net in Python using just Numpy. I spent time diligently reading this
    book, discussing implementations with peers, and developing my code.  At any rate, I implemented and fully
    understand just about every single line of code. From optimizers, to backpropogation, its all in Numpy! Feel free
    to reach out if you have any questions. Also I used this to develop a model to predict significant coronary disease
    in patients, using <a href="http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/acath.xls.zip">this</a> dataset.
    I achieved a prediction accuracy of ~75%. (<a href="https://github.com/Addison-Weatherhead/ML-Project">Github link</a> for this project).

    <h5>ProjectX: March-November 2020</h5>
    I worked with a team at UofT AI to design, schedule, and prepare a 3 month long machine learning research
    competition aimed at incentivizing undergraduates to get involved in ML research. I worked on this project essentially
    from inception (in February-March of 2020) to execution (Sept-Nov of 2020). While my role was technically
    'External Relations Executive', I wore many hats. Early in the process I worked with 2 other students to reach
    out to dozens of universities and colleges across North America to field teams. This was especially difficult
    as the Covid pandemic was just getting into full swing, so CS departments at these institutions were preoccupied
    with going online. However, we were eventually able to register over 20 teams (including teams from MIT, Stanford,
    Carnegie Mellon, and UC Berkley to name a few). I also worked to find folks in academia and industry who would
    donate their time to guide the teams, and as a result I secured nearly all of the (UofT AI provided) mentors for
    this competition. At the end of the summer, I was given a new role: 'Director of Logistics'. In this role I helped
    lead the charge in interfacing with teams (particularly answering their questions throughout the competition)
    and making sure we provide clear, accurate, and consistent information to the participants. You can see our website
    <a href="https://www.projectx2020.com">here</a>. <br>
    We were also featured on <a href="https://thestrand.ca/projectx-a-research-event-hosted-by-artificial-intelligence-at-uoft/">The Strand</a>,
